# This is the first main we'll start with. This is the 'pure' form of the Strategy pattern as seen in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern and the easiest to understand.

# We start with the same projectile. Regardless of if we're on earth, the moon, mars or space, we have a projectile that travels with an initial velocity of 100 m/s at a 45Â° angle.
p: BaseProjectile = BaseProjectile(100, 45)

# Here's the magic. When we want to get the distance, we give a different type of strategy depending on the conditions. The returned distance will change, despite using the same projectile.
